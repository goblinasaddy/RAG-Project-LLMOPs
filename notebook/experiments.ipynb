The students visit any one country of their choice, complete pre-defined \\ncredits units under the international faculty. The advantage of SAP is hands-on experience of \\ngaining knowledge of foreign culture, industry, and economic dynamics. It provides the \\nstudents with an opportunity to interact with foreign faculty and carry out focused projects \\nunder their expert guidance. For further details please go to URL https://www.amity.edu/sap/\\n2.15 THREE CONTINENT PROGRAMMES (3C PROGRAMMES)\\nAmity is a pioneer in developing and initiating 3C programmes in India. In this program, \\nstudents gain unique exposure through studying in 3 different continents namely Asia, Europe \\nand America. While the initial Semesters are completed at Amity University, as part of the \\nprogram students spend 3 Months in U.K. and 3 Months in US.\\nStudents in this program will pursue part of their Programme in India undergoing rigorous \\ntraining in various technologies, cross-cultural issues, foreign languages and international \\npractices. They will then proceed to spend a substantial portion of this programme in the UK & \\nUSA. Industry interaction, cultural awareness, foreign language training, and experience in the \\nlatest technological environment will allow each student to gain a deep insight of what it takes \\nto be a truly global leader.\\n2.16 STUDENT EXCHANGE PROGRAMME (SEP)\\nStudents get the opportunity to go to different Universities all over the world and international \\nstudents visit Amity campus as part of the student exchange programme.\\n2.17 INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMMES\\nAmity University offers under Global Study Programme, a unique international lateral transfer \\nprogram, where the students spend one or two years at Amity in India and the balance number \\nof years of the degree at a university of their choice abroad.\\nThe final award of a degree is from the Foreign University at a fraction of the cost compared to \\nstudying for the entire duration abroad. Key advantages are the students can earn degrees from \\ntop international universities and provision for post study related work permits etc.\\nFor further details, students are requested to consult their Programme Leader/\\nHead of Institution.'"
